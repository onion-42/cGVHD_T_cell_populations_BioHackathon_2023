**Analysis of T-cells immunological landscape and its association with graft-versus-host disease**

Transplantation of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells allows achieving a biological cure in patients with leukemia. But the main reason for the decrease of disease-free survival and quality of life is chronic graft-versus-host disease (chronic GVHD), which develops in more than half of patients. Chronic GVHD remains a clinical diagnosis but attempts are being made worldwide to find diagnostic markers of this complication. The pathogenesis of this condition is not fully understood, but the role of T-lymphocytes has been proven.

A large dataset of immunological data is presented (analysis of the subpopulation composition of T-lymphocytes - 162 subpopulations) for 70 patients after stem cells transplantation. Chronic GVHD developed in 28 of these 70 patients.

**Purpose**: application of modern data processing and visualization technologies for the prediction and characterization of chronic GVHD.

Task 1: Identify landscape of T cells and their combination in patients after allo-HSCT.
Task 2: Using biostatistics and machine learning methods identify the relationship between T cells and their combination in patients after allo-HSCT and development of cGVHD.
Task 3: Visualize using t-SNE, PCA and etc.  T cells populations in patients who develop cGVHD and who not. 

# Dataset preprocessing

## Potential duplicates 

We have dropped potential duplicates for which 90% of the data or higher had Spearman rho values different by 0.05 or lower. 8 pairs different by markers of maturity or activity, but not by the identified cell type, were found. We have dropped the populations that had less information about the population.
